## Radar Data Visualizer

This project is designed to visualize radar logs, which can be generated by a radar and include point clouds and clustered objects. However, to validate the accuracy of the initial clustering, this visualizer was developed.

In the screenshot, red dots represent the radar's point cloud, green dots showcase custom clustering using DBSCAN, and yellow dots represent the radar's original clustering.

Data is updated every second based on the radar detection timestamp.
## Features

   1. Log Reading: The system reads and interprets radar logs for effective visualization.
   2. Custom Clustering: Utilizes DBSCAN for custom clustering of radar data.
   3. Comparison: Allows users to compare the original radar clustering with the custom clustering results.
   4. Real-time Updates: Data is refreshed every second to reflect the latest radar detection information.

## Usage

  1. Data Source: Ensure that the radar log files are accessible and specify the correct file path.
  2. Build and Run: Compile the project using the provided build instructions.
  3. Visualization: Launch the visualizer to observe the radar's point cloud and clustering results.
  4. Validation: Compare the custom clustering against the original radar clustering for validation.

Feel free to explore and enhance the visualizer to meet your specific requirements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
